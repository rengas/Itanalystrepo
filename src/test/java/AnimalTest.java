    1 a. How did you unit test it?
        Unit testing primary done on methods that change the state of the object.
        In the given classes walk,fly and sing are only creating side effects as the return type is
        void. It is only wise to unit test methods that return something, which
        can help us determine whether the state of the object has changed.
